This project began because I needed something like it myself.

During periods of stress, burnout, and major life transition, I noticed how quickly the nervous system can move into overwhelm and how few tools exist that feel calm, non-judgmental, and genuinely supportive in those moments. Many mental health apps feel either overly motivational or focused on tracking and optimisation rather than care.

In te ao Māori, wellbeing is not treated as a single problem to fix. Te Whare Tapa Whā teaches that when one wall of the whare is under strain, the whole structure is affected. Balance is not about perfection; it is about noticing, responding, and restoring steadiness.

This project uses generative AI in a gentle and intentional way — not to replace therapy, nature, or human connection, but to support grounding, regulation, and reconnection in everyday moments.

Phase One is intentionally simple. It prioritises safety, trust, and nervous system regulation over insight or analysis. The aim is not to change the user, but to support a return to calm presence, even if only briefly.
