# Phase One Feature List

Phase One focuses on creating a calm, safe, and intentionally limited wellbeing companion.
The goal is to support brief moments of grounding and nervous system regulation during overwhelm.

No feature in this phase should add cognitive load, pressure, or expectation.

## Core Features

### 1. Pause Entry Point
- A simple landing interaction that invites the user to pause
- No sign-up required
- No urgency or calls to action
- Language centred on choice and agency

Purpose:
Reduce friction and allow immediate access during overwhelm.

---

### 2. Grounding Interaction (AI-Guided)
- Short, calm prompts generated by AI
- Focus on breath, body, or present-moment noticing
- One prompt at a time
- No follow-up chains unless user opts in

Purpose:
Support regulation without analysis or problem-solving.

---

### 3. User-Controlled Pacing
- The user can:
  - Continue
  - Pause
  - End the interaction at any point
- No automatic progression
- No time pressure

Purpose:
Maintain a sense of safety and control.

---

### 4. Tone and Language Guardrails
- Calm, neutral, non-intrusive language
- No motivational or productivity framing
- No advice or interpretation
- No exclamation marks or urgency cues

Purpose:
Prevent emotional escalation or pressure.

---

### 5. Gentle Exit
- A soft closing message
- No summary, score, or reflection required
- Optional encouragement to reconnect with the body, environment, or a safe person

Purpose:
End the interaction without expectation or evaluation.

## Safety Features

### 6. Distress-Aware Response
- If the user expresses heightened distress:
  - The AI responds with grounding language only
  - Encourages reaching out to trusted human support
- No crisis intervention or emergency instructions

Purpose:
Respect boundaries while prioritising care.

---

### 7. Clear Boundary Messaging
- Transparent language indicating the AI’s limits
- Visible but non-alarming
- Reinforces that this is a support tool, not therapy

Purpose:
Build trust through honesty.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase One)

- User accounts or authentication
- Mood tracking or scoring
- Journalling or long-form reflection
- Insights, summaries, or pattern detection
- Notifications or reminders
- Personalisation based on history

These features may be explored in later phases only if they align with the project’s safety and wellbeing principles.

## Phase One Success Criteria

Phase One is successful if:
- The experience feels calm and non-demanding
- Users can engage briefly and leave easily
- No interaction feels intrusive or overwhelming
- The AI remains within clearly defined boundaries

If a feature complicates this experience, it does not belong in Phase One.
