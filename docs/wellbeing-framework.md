# Wellbeing Framework

Pause is informed by Te Whare Tapa Whā, a Māori model of wellbeing that recognises health as a balance between interconnected dimensions.

Rather than treating wellbeing as a problem to solve, this framework views wellbeing as something that is continually noticed, supported, and restored.

## Te Whare Tapa Whā Overview

Te Whare Tapa Whā describes wellbeing as a whare (house) supported by four walls:

- Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)
- Taha Hinengaro (mental and emotional wellbeing)
- Taha Whānau (connection and relationships)
- Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing and meaning)

When one wall is under strain, the stability of the whole structure is affected.

## How This Framework Informs the Project

Pause does not attempt to assess or measure the state of these dimensions.  
Instead, the framework guides the *tone*, *focus*, and *boundaries* of interactions.

The app supports moments of grounding that may gently touch one or more dimensions without forcing reflection or change.

### Taha Tinana
- Breath awareness
- Body-based grounding
- Sensory noticing
- Rest and slowing down

### Taha Hinengaro
- Non-judgemental language
- Emotional validation without interpretation
- Reducing cognitive load during overwhelm

### Taha Whānau
- Encouraging reconnection to safe people and support
- Acknowledging the importance of not being alone
- No substitution for real human connection

### Taha Wairua
- Quiet presence
- Meaning through stillness rather than instruction
- Respect for values, beliefs, and personal grounding practices

## Cultural Respect and Scope

This project does not claim to represent or teach Te Whare Tapa Whā.  
The framework is used respectfully as a guiding worldview rather than a feature set.

The intention is alignment, not appropriation.

## Design Principle

Wellbeing is supported through gentle interruption of overwhelm, not optimisation or self-improvement.

If an interaction adds pressure, urgency, or expectation, it does not align with this framework.
